Normally this works well, but sometimes if significant changes are made to the settings between runs some inappropiate optimizations are done. Disabling the optimizer means a generate run takes longer but ensures that the expected results are obtained. It is recommended that the optimizer is left enabled unless you find that some changes to the settings do not seem to be reflected in the catalog that is being generated. In such a case disabling the optimizer for one run should correct things. You can then normally enable it again for subsequent runs to reduce the time taken to generate the catalog." "false";
